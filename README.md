# ðŸš€ Astro Component Library

This is my astro component library to build out static sites quicker.

## /src file structure

/assets -> static assets for fonts, global css, and images

/components -> smaller components such as cards, buttons, logos etc

/layout -> Should only have 1 Layout.astro file here. This is the base layout for the site and will contain section blocks, components, and HTML

/pages -> All pages for the site

/sections -> larger groups of components/HTML that are used frequently
